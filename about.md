# Work #
<br/>
I'm Rob, and I work for a Managed Services Provider and Consulting firm, based in __Western Canada__. Currently, I'm focused on Tier 3 operational support for our Managed Services clients, and therefore I get exposed to a large number of _unique_ Network designs and configurations. I hold a number of Cisco and industry certifications including __CCNP__ R&amp;S, and my efforts are currently focused on passing my CCIE R&amp;S lab exam before I hit the ripe old age of 30.

While R&amp;S topics are definitely my focus at the moment, I'm a __nerd__ at heart and love all aspects of technology. I'd definitely like to think I'm not just a _Router Jockey_, as I'm interested in many broad topics of computing; I have an __insatiable__ desire to learn about everything.

# Self #
<br/> 
I'm an __INFJ__, a __concrete sequential__ thinker, and I'm a bit (okay, a lot) of a __perfectionist__.

Originally from __Leeds__, England, I now reside in Western Canada amongst the snow and igloos. I'm a life-long __Leeds United__ (Football) supporter, and my lovely fianc√©e and I are both die-hard __Calgary Flames__ (Hockey) fans. I play __Football__ (Soccer, for you American types) in my spare time to keep my legs moving, I love photography, and when I (seldom) have time I like to nerd it up on the PS3.

I love Apple, OSX, Linux, virtualization, open source, BIND, vim, Batman, Chuck Taylor's, and about a bjillion other cool things.

# Contact #
<br/>
I generally lurk on Freenode as __MrThePlague__, in channels such as #cisco, #packetpushers, #dns among others; however, it's probably easiest to get in touch via email or the Twitters.
