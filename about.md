# Work #
<br/>
I'm Robert, and I work for a Value Added Reseller/Consulting firm/Managed Services Provider, based in __Western Canada__. My role involves me in the entire lifecycle of a project, from pre-sales, to architecture, implementation, day 2 support and beyond; therefore I get exposed to a large number of unique environments, and am asked to solve many unique problems.

While my role at this time is focussed on more traditional networking, I'm a __nerd__ at heart and love all aspects of technology including virtualization, automation, and Cloud computing. I believe in breaking down silos, and in the value of being a well-rounded Engineer. Furthermore, I believe in the concept of __Infrastructure as Code__ -- implementing the processes and concepts of the development lifecycle such as configuration management, version control, continuous integration, etc. 

# Self #
<br/>
I'm an __INFJ__, a __concrete sequential__ thinker, and I'm a bit (okay, a lot) of a __perfectionist__.

Originally from __Leeds__, England, I now reside in Western Canada amongst the snow and igloos. I'm a life-long __Leeds United__ (Football) supporter, and my lovely Wife and I are both __Calgary Flames__ (Hockey) season ticket holders. I play __Football__ (Soccer, for you American types) in my spare time to keep my legs moving, I love photography, and when I (seldom) have time I like to nerd it up on the PS4.

I love Batman, Apple, OS X, Linux, virtualization, open source, BIND, Vim, Chuck Taylor's, and about a million other cool things.

# Contact #
<br/>
I generally lurk on Freenode as __MrThePlague__, in channels such as #cisco, #openstack, #ansible, and #packetpushers among others; however, it's probably easiest to get in touch via the Twitters.
